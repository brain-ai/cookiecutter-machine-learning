# cookiecutter-machine-learning
A cookiecutter template for machine learning projects. Keeps things clean and scalable even in the unpredictable world of ML. 

We used our work experience as machine learning engineers to see what is always needed in a ML project. We took the insight and turned it into a scalable and lightweight directory and file structure that would help fellow scientists read your code easier. 

We trust it will also help you recreate your experiments when needed and scale seamlessly everytime you would like to try another model analysis.
